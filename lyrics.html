            <p>I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
                Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)</p>

            <p>I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
                I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
                I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
                Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here</p>

            <p>Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)<br>
                Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)<br>
                Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)<br>
                Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here</p>

            <p>I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
                Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
                I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
                Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey</p>

            <p>When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (Ooh)<br>
                You're the reason I believe in love<br>
                It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)<br>
                And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
                Ain't no way that I can leave you
